# jre16
modefied version of the AUR version https://aur.archlinux.org/pkgbase/jdk/

This is to say that I simply removed the automatic installation of "jdk" and "java-eviroment-common" when installing with makepkg in the PKGBUILD.
Since I did not touch anythin else all the credit goes to: dbermond (https://aur.archlinux.org/account/dbermond) the maintainer of the original AUR-package.

When you have any ideas on how to remove any extra, unneeded files that are only related to "jdk" or "java-eviroment-common" and thus not needed in this version, hit me up.

All this will become obsolete as soon as jre16 is available in the arch-linux repos.
